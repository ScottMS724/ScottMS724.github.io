As somebody that is new to the world of programming, I am familiar with the overwhelming sense that there is way too much to learn. It is easy to search around on the internet and see code that is so far beyond your level of comprehension that it may as well be magic. For myself, as someone that must learn all the basics and fundamentals, the key is to stay focused on what you are learning at the moment and realize that at some point, everyone had a day one. It is the challenge of learning how the fundamentals lead into the more advanced concepts and techniques that will turn the supposed magic into understanding.

As I worked towards my first project, the question of how to start coding and go from just an idea in my head, to workable, programmable steps proved to be one of the primary challenges. Essentially, "how do I start?" A blank canvass is truly intimidating. While working on this project, I came upon some helpful advice from a YouTube video (http://tinyurl.com/y4jz59us) by Avi Flombaum in which he walks through his own example CLI gem. He also outlines how to best start up a new project and conquer the dreaded "blank slate" at the beginning, and how to best turn the ideas in your head into code. Here I will outline some of the cues and questions to ask yourself that I found most helped me in coding my CLI gem, my first programming project.

It helps to begin the thought process with "what is the code I wish I had?" This will help direct your thinking towards how you want the eventual finished program to operate. From there, you can begin to work on the base structure of the project, the "skeleton," essentially. Along with figuring out what the code you wished you had would do, ask yourself what information the CLI will need from the user. What questions does the CLI have to ask, and how will it incorporate these answers from the user? This is a good base of issues to work on to get the ball rolling on a new project. At this point, you may only have some basic classes and maybe some methods, but at least there is a foundation and a direction to build off of.

From this base structure, the flow of the program can be worked out. CLI asks this question, user inputs this answer, CLI returns this information, etc... You can begin to "stub out the interface" as Avi says. "Fake", or hard-coded data, can be incorporated into the base structure of the program to begin to give the CLI life, even if the data it is using is not dynamic, scraped data from an external website. The hard-coded data serves to allow the flow of the program to be observed and see if the code is functioning properly and that the program will be doing what you want it to do with the scraped data. 

From here, assuming the interface is worked out with the hard-coded data, it is simply a matter of scraping the actual data from a website. While not easy, at least the interface is worked out, and with the correct scrape, will hopefully become a fully functioning gem.

With programming, there is a certain amount of willingness to search for solutions to coding issues. Most likely, many people have struggled with the same problem you are, and the answer can be found as long as you can ask the right questions. This is why "google-fu" or savvyness with a search engine is important when programming, as Avi stresses in the video. It can be useful especially in your early projects where you will inevitably have many questions that have been answered before many times.

I am looking forward to using these techniques in future projects. Good luck everybody.
