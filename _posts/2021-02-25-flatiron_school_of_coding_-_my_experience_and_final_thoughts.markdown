These past few years of working through the self-paced, online full stack web development curriculum have been quite a whirlwind. Everything took longer than anticipated as I spent the better part of a year dealing with a serious medical issue. Thankfully, that is all in the past now, and coding with Flatiron provided an excellent distraction that I could focus on as I went through everything. Additionally, as an avid gamer and someone with a background in the fitness industry, coding allowed me to channel my developed grit and attrition into solving problems with apps/websites. 

I initially chose Flatiron due to the appeal of being able to work from home, on a computer, at my own pace. This allowed me to be flexible with my clients for personal training. I was, admittedly, sometimes pretty slow in getting through certain projects or concepts, as I started this course with no background in computer science, or programming in any way. However, Flatiron's curriculum was efficient in teaching me what I needed to know (as far as most popular/most current technology and methods), and broke the subject matters into more digestible pieces, eventually building up to the projects. Making sure the student is actually programming their own apps and building a portfolio of their own is a huge part of why Flatiron is so successful at imparting the know-how required to get ones foot in the software development industry.

**Next Steps**

Learning is constant in programming as the technologies used in development are evolving and updating. I plan to do something every day to continue learning, whether it's working on a personal project, or contributing to a project on GitHub, or doing coding exercises to practice for technical interviews. I plan to update my presence online for employment through LinkedIn and working with my career coach to find a good starter position. 

Good luck to everyone currently working through the Flatiron curriculum and trying to acheive their goals in coding. We're all going to make it.
