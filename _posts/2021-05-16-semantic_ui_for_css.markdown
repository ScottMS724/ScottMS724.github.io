As a full stack web developer that wants a simple but effective CSS framework, Semantic UI is a great tool for the job. It's powered by the Less CSS pre-compiler and jQuery. As can be inferred from it's name, the classes that do the styling in Semantic are clear and direct. Nothing is abbreviated or vague. This means the initial learning curve for Semantic tends to be a bit more forgiving and designing a page is less time consuming. 

Another big pro about Semantic are the many themes available for use. There is a lot of variety to all the layouts. This is similar to Bootstrap, but I think Semantic provides a bit more customization here if you are willing to go deep. 

Right now, Semantic seems to be less popular than frameworks like Bootstrap. In my opinion, it's underrated! Consider checking it out if you want a fresh look for your websites and are used to other frameworks. If a unique design is not your top priority and you have time to spare, Bootstrap is probably the framework to go to. However, if you want a framework that can be a time-saver but also provide a light-weight, sleek look, with a low initial learning curve, consider Semantic.
