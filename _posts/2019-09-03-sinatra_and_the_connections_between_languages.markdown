As I discussed in my first blog post about building the CLI gem for the first project, learning to code can be intimidating when you are first starting out. Advanced concepts and languages can look like gibberish and there is seemingly an endless amount of information that one could delve deeply into. As the Flatiron School course has progressed and the curriculum flows between the different languages and concepts, I've begun to see how they all connect and work together to create a functioning application. 

	The value of being a "full stack" developer is evident by the time you reach the Sinatra final project. In a completed Sinatra app, front-end programming languages interact with back-end languages to create the fully working program. Essentially, the languages rely on each other and it is useful to be able to work with all of these moving parts yourself so you can realize the vision of the app to what you have imagined and to its fullest potential. 

	The task of the Sinatra final project was to create an app that used recently learned principles such as "MVC" (Model-View-Controller), "CRUD" (Create, Read, Update, Delete), and of course the ORM (Object Relational Mapping) in conjunction with HTTPs and ActiveRecord. The app had to incorporate sign up/log in/log out functions for a User class with associations such as belongs_to and has_many between the models. Building an app in this way with Sinatra and ActiveRecord is a good way to understand what is happening "under the hood" so to speak with bigger, more complex frameworks such as Rails. These frameworks do a lot of required, repetitive tasks for developers automatically, but it is still useful to understand how they do what they do in order to create better apps and truly be an expert in the tools you are incorporating. 

	I look forward to diving into Rails and really getting into the nitty gritty of modern programming. Thank you for reading.
