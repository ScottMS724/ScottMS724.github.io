As one progresses through their web developer education, they will become familiar with the terms "frontend" and "backend." These terms refer to the two sides of a fully functional application or website. The "frontend" being everything the user sees and directly interacts with on their browser. The "backend" is where all this data is organized and stored, ready to be read or summoned for display by the frontend. In our case, the backend is composed of Rails, and of course the frontend is composed of JavaScript (and HTML/CSS). It had been somewhat foggy to me how it all comes together to create a fully functional application until building a website for my final vanilla JavaScript project. There are a lot of moving parts and different programming languages interacting with each other, so until I built a project, these machinations remained somewhat obscure. Admittedly, I stuck to a fairly MVP (minimal viable product) for my website, but now my foundational understanding of how these two ends of an application work in tandem is much improved and well substantiated as I move into the React curriculum. 

One of the techniques that greatly helped me is the "JavaScript Mantra" I learned from Flatiron Instructor Ayana Zaire about how to think about implementing functionality with JavaScript and how the frontend and backend work together. The mantra goes like this: "when some event happens, what kind of fetch must be executed, and how will the DOM be manipulated?" It seems simple, but this mantra shows how the two ends work together, and gives an idea of how to proceed with the code. Event -> Fetch -> DOM. Event -> Fetch -> DOM. This basic pattern cleared up how to think about the interaction of the frontend and backend and how to structure code.

Simple techniques such as a mantra or saying can help make an otherwise complicated feat into a more simple, digestible process. Happy coding, all!
